# Software-Development-Processes-Parody-Compilation

# 1. SDD – Sales Driven Development

Sales sold a non-existent solution to a huge client and now the developers have to make it work somehow.

# 2. SOOP – Stack Overflow Oriented Programming

When you really haven’t got a clue about what you’re doing but have located Stack Overflow.

# 3. HDD: Hormone Driven Development

Development done by some young guys who think they know it all. These HDD kids lack social skills and tend to write convoluted, over engineered code hoping to impress everybody (even the old guys they despise). Instead of taking advantage of being mentored by older developers who have been writing code since these young dummies were still in their mother’s ovaries, they are arrogant self-promoting, blowhards who are TOO STUPID to know they suck as a developers. They are too immature to understand that the older guys have met and overcome challenges in their careers unknown and unfathomable to these young maggots. Sometimes these young ‘uns are even promoted into an ADD position for a short term until they fail and are removed.

# 4. DNFL (Drunk Now – Fix Later) approach

# 5. HDS (Happy Debugging Suckers) technique

# 6. OGCJM (Only God Can Judge Me) development

# 7. EDD – Error Driven Development. 

Cubicle dwellers are constantly putting out fires, chasing bugs, fixing bugs, debugging, patching bad code, breaking data type interfaces, all because of short-sighted managers who love golf more than software quality. Combined with silly rules like “be here by 8am” regardless of 60 hour weeks and saturdays/sundays. EDD mimicks natural control systems found in nature

# 8. ISRAEDD ::= IntelliSense R# Alter+Enter Driven Developement

Press Ctrl+Space choose something and, press Alt+Enter to add reference no matter which layer, choose a method and think “If it is public then it is OK”.

# 9. WHD = Work Hours Development

A development process where developers make things work in dirtiest possible way just to mark their work hours for the bosses that they did something.

# 10.JAFA - Just A Few Alterations Development

consists of a team of at least 100 software engineers spending at least 5 years on fixing up, bootstrapping and building around a quick piece of software made by 5 people for 6 months.

# 11. [SUF] Soviet Union Factory methodology

Documentation is not existent, one dev doesn’t know what other one is doing or what an overall project should do. Given small and specific tasks they stumble in the code blindly. Communication is kept to zero. Code is full of methods who perform exact same function. Patterns are either non existent or there’s as much of them as there’s developers rendering any effort to keep structure clean useless. Management thinks project is too big to fail

# 12. DPT - Defcon Prioritization Technique. 

Where there always are multiple levels of artificial urgency to make sure the everyone keep busy and on their toes.

# 13. Johnny Cash Development (JCD)

It’s where I waste a day trying to understand your worthless code while humming to the tune of “God’s Gonna Cut You Down”

# 14. SalesIdiot Driven Development (SIDD)

Where, in flagrant violation of the correct procedures, a maverick salesdroid has sold something that doesn’t exist, probably can’t exist, or would take an eternity to make exist, it’s the company’s BIGGEST BREAK EVER, and must be done next week to exacting specifications already agreed with the customer. By the salesdroid. Alone. Given the deal value, the CEO’s reluctantly had to support it. Off you go, then. Fully working prototype by – um – Thursday work for you?

# 15. Wheel-Reinvention-Driven Development (WRIDD)

MySQL can’t hack it, and doesn’t support an obscure feature that we probably don’t need anyway. PostgreSQL had a bug in the last release. So. We’re going to write our own database, because we can do in two weeks what Oracle, MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL couldn’t manage in a decade or three.

# 16. PDD – Panic Driven Development

Reacting quickly to sales requirements with no planning, tests or wider business value. “We’re gonna lose this customer unless we add in this customer specific thing they forgot to tell us about!”

# 17. CIMTD – Console is my therapist development

The mode of development when the dev is not very confident and logs variables every 2 lines. Console is their therapist and they tell it everything.

# 18. I95%DD (It’s 95% done development).

When business gets so frustrated with IT timelines (because the developers are dealing with multiple of the aforementioned methodologies) that they tape and glue something together with whatever is on hand(Access, Excel, VBA, macros, SharePoint, etc) and call it an application and then turn it over to IT saying it’s 95% complete and just needs to be ‘productionalized’.. IT then has to take the realistically 10% proof of failure (POF), reverse engineer requirements, design and code some level of first phase while being harassed daily (hourly?) by an entry level project manager who maintains that business almost made it on little budget and just a few weeks (or months) of effort.

# 19. LCDLC – Loose Coupling DeadLine Caring

when your PO can’t be bothered with progress and specifications but suddenly wants to change everything and add a plethora of new shit two weeks before delivery.

# 20. Hammer Driven Development (HDD)

Hit it with a hammer until it works. If it doesnt work, get a bigger hammer. Get into production via jack hammer.
